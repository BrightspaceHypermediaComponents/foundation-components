A collection of shareable, stateful components that interact with hypermedia APIs. These components can be used to build pages for anything that uses the D2L Hypermedia API.

## Example

```js
import '@brightspace-hmc/foundation-components/components/activity/name/d2l-activity-name.js';
import { html } from '@brightspace-hmc/foundation-engine/framework/hypermedia-components.js';
import { LitElement } from 'lit-element/lit-element.js';

class MyComponent extends LitElement {
  render() {
    return html`
      <d2l-activity-name href="url-to-a-learning-path-entity" token="some-token"></d2l-activity-name>
    `;
  }
}
```

The above will render the name of a learning path. The tag `d2l-activity-name` will **automatically resolve** to `d2l-activity-name-learning-path` based on the **classes** in the hypermedia entity.

The components are **stateful** because they react to changes to the entity. Components are bi-directional with their entity states &mdash; they can read the state of and perform actions on their entities.

### Creating New Components

See [Creating new components](creating-new-components.md).

## Developing, Testing and Contributing

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` to install dependencies.

### Running the demos

To start an [es-dev-server](https://open-wc.org/developing/es-dev-server.html) that hosts the demo page and tests:

```shell
npm start
```

### Testing

To lint:

```shell
npm run lint
```

To run local unit tests:

```shell
npm run test:local
```

To run both linting and unit tests:

```

## Versioning, Releasing & Deploying

All version changes should obey [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) rules.

Include either `[increment major]`, `[increment minor]` or `[increment patch]` in your merge commit message to automatically increment the `package.json` version and create a tag.

## Future Enhancements

* Error reporting
* Screenshots for component Readmes
* Support for Working Copy
