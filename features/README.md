# Feature-specific Components

This space is designated for `foundation` components built for specific features in Brightspace. Their state may not yet be fully shareable. Components in this folder will eventually be moved to the `components` folder when they are vetted and meet fully shareable criteria.

**To be fully shareable,** components must:

- Be general enough to cover more than one use case or tool
- Align to the style in the `components` folder
- Have documentation
- Be localized (if applicable)
- Be reviewed by `foundation` codeowners
